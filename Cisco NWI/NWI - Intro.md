# 1 Networking Today
## 1.1 Networks Affect our Lives
> Nothing important

## 1.2 Network Components
### 1.2.1 Host Roles

**Hosts**
> All computers connected to a network and who participate directly in network communication/

- has IP address
	- Identifies the host and the network to which host is attached

**Servers**
> Computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to end devices.

- Server software per service
- Service can be provided to multiple clients simultaneously

**Clients**
> Clients are a type of host, who have software for requesting and displaying the information obtained from the server.

### 1.2.2 Peer-to-Peer

- 1 host can be both client and server
	- E.g.: small businesses & homes
	- = Peer-to-Peer network
![[Pasted image 20240303104450.png]]
**Advantages:**
- Easy to set up
- Less complex
- Lower cost because network devices and dedicated servers may not be required
- Can be used for simple tasks such as transferring files and sharing printers
**Disadvantages:**
- No centralized admin
- Not as secure
- Not scalable
- May slow performance

### 1.2.3 End Devices

- Each end device on a network has an address
	- Source address
	- Destination Address
- E.g.: Phone, Laptop

### 1.2.4 Intermediary Devices

> Connect the individual end devices to the network. Can connect multiple individual networks to form internetwork.

**Common intermediary devices:**
- Wireless router
- LAN switch
- Router
- Multilayer switch
- Firewall appliance

### 1.2.5 Network Media

> Communication transmits across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

**3 typical media:**
- Copper wire:
	- Ethernet
	- Coax
- Fiber-optic
- Wireless

## 1.3 Network Representations and Topologies
### 1.3.1 Network Representations
![[Pasted image 20240303105459.png]]
